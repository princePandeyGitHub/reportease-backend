# postmybuild

Generate AI-ready social media prompts for your projects directly from the terminal.

## What is postmybuild?

postmybuild is a CLI tool that helps developers quickly generate prompts for AI tools (like ChatGPT or Gemini) to create posts about their projects on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), or Instagram. It scans your project’s `package.json` and README (if available) and generates a concise prompt that’s automatically copied to your clipboard.
